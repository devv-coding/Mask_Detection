# Mask_Detection
OpenCV project to identify whether a person is wearing a mask or not in Python using Tensorflow, Keras, Caffemodel and Numpy.
I have used my own dataset stored on local drive collected from different sources and acheived good accuracy overall. I have also reffered to PyImageSearch for this project.

Result:
